# Python Codes

This repository contains various Python programs created during my learning journey.  
The codes cover concepts such as:

- Loops and Conditional Statements
- Functions and Modules
- File Handling
- Data Structures (Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets)


## How to Run
1. Download the `.py` file you want to try.
2. Open it in any Python IDE (like VS Code or PyCharm) or terminal.
3. Run:
   ```bash
   python filename.py
